I live in a house near the city.
I have one sister, and I was born last.
My father teaches mathematics, and my mother is a paralegal.
My sister is a nervous girl, but she is very kind.
My grandmother also lives with us.
She has grown old, but she is still very strong.
She cooks the best food!
My family is very important to me.
We do lots of things together.
My sister likes to cook with my grandmother.
On the weekends we all play board games together.
We laugh and always have a good time.
I love my family very much.
